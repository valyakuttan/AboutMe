       Welcome to the Android developer guides. The documents listed in the left
       navigation teach you how to build Android apps using APIs in the Android
       framework and other libraries. If you\'re brand new to Android and want to
       jump into code, start with the Build Your First App tutorial.
       And check out these other resources to learn Android development:

       Codelabs: Short, self-paced tutorials that each cover a discrete topic. Most
       codelabs step you through the process of building a small app, or adding a
       new feature to an existing app.

       Courses: Guided training paths that teach you how to build Android apps.
       Online training: If you prefer to learn online with videos, check out the
       Developing Android Apps with Kotlin course on Udacity (trailer embedded here),
       and other online courses below.

       Otherwise, the following is a small selection of essential developer guides that
       you should be familiar with.
